So far I've lived and died as a quiet farmer, brutal warrior, a god, and many others. At times I forget why I'm out here. I've gone years without remembering my goal of reaching Andromeda, but last week I picked up signatures of activity very similar to the drone incident. I've decided to head straight for it. it will be good to see something again, anything really."
